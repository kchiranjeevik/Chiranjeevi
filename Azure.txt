IP addressing & Subnetting

IP Address:
IP stands for Internet Protocol. An IP Address is used as a unique identifier for a resource in a network or an organization. 
An IP address can be of the type IPV4 or IPV6. We will be discussing only IPv4 addressing in this article. IPv4 is the most widely used IP address across the globe. 
An IPv4 is a 32-bit address divided into four octets separated by a period (. dot), each octet carrying 8 bits. 

Public IP Address: An IP used over the internet, or you can say which is routable over the internet.

Private IP Address: An IP that is used within the private network(Intranet).

Subnetting:
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number with 0's and 1's used to divide host and network bits. Host bits are set to 0, 
and network bits are set to 1. Using Host bits, you can also calculate the number of IPs and determine the IP range



IP4:32-bit 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, IP6 : 128 bit
Class A:1.0.0.1 to 126.255.255.254
Private IP range:10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
Class B:128.1.0.1 to 191.255.255.254
Private IP range:172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
Class C:192.0.1.1 to 223.255.255.254
Private IP range:192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

Private IP ranges are also called as Non-internet Routable Address

Resorce Group:
A resource group is a logical container that associates multiple resources so you can manage them as a single entity—based on lifecycle and security. 
For example, you can create or delete resources as a group if the resources share a similar lifecycle—such as the resources for an N-tier application



NSG is similar to AWS security Group
